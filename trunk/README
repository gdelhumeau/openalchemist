OpenAlchemist - Development version
-----------------------------------

I) What OpenAlchemist needs ?

OpenAlchemist is based on ClanLib 2.1. You must install it before compiling this game. You can find the last version of clanlib at: http://www.clanlib.org

You may have to edit the /etc/ld.so.conf and add to it "/etc/local/lib". Then run "ldconfig" as root.

You also need the "zip" program, in order to make skins archives.

II) How to compile/install it

There is two ways :
	1 - Use GNU autotools
	It's the classic chain "./configure && make && sudo make install".
	See "INSTALL" for more informations

	2 - Use the custom Makefile
	More simple, it's for local use (don't try make install). Usefull for developpers.
	Just tip "make -f MyMakefile", and then "./openalchemist" to run the game.

III) How to play with it

After compiling, tip "openalchemist".
