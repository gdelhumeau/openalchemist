OpenAlchemist - Development version
-----------------------------------

I) What OpenAlchemist needs ?

OpenAlchemist is based on ClanLib 0.8 RC2. You must install it before compiling this game. You can find the last version of clanlib at: http://www.clanlib.org

You may have to edit the /etc/ld.so.conf and add to it "/etc/local/lib". Then run "ldconfig" as root.

If you understand french, you can read a tutorial here: http://kephpage.free.fr/note.php?mid=197

II) How to compile it

You should just tape "make" in this folder. If it doesn't work, you should edit the makefile.

In the future, OpenAlchemist will have a simplified compilation system with autoconf, automake, ect...
