OpenAlchemist - Development version
-----------------------------------

I) What OpenAlchemist needs ?

OpenAlchemist is based on ClanLib 0.8. You must install it before compiling this game. You can find the last version of clanlib at: http://www.clanlib.org

You may have to edit the /etc/ld.so.conf and add to it "/etc/local/lib". Then run "ldconfig" as root.

II) How to install it

First, you must have installed Scons (http://http://www.scons.org/) on your computer. Then, you should just tape "scons" in this folder. If it doesn't work, you should edit the SConstruct file.

Then tip :
"./install" (with root)
(will be install into /usr/local/games/openalchemist folder)

III) How to play with it

After compiling, tip "openalchemist-config".

IV) How to package it

Tip "./make-package.sh" then look into "package.tar.gz" to understand. 
Dependencies : clanlib
If you to make a dependencies-free binary, just tip "./make-static.sh" and replace /usr/local/games/openalchemist/openalchemit by openalchemist-static in package file.
